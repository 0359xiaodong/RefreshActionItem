RefreshActionItem
=================

An action bar item implementing a common pattern: initially a refresh button is shown, and when the button is clicked a background operation begins and the button turns into a progress indicator until the operation ends, at which point the button is restored to its initial state.

The progress indicator can be determinate or indeterminate. If the determinate mode is used, it is possible to choose between two styles: "wheel" and "pie". 

It is also possible to have the refresh button be invisible initially, which makes this action item behave like a replacement for the built-in indeterminate action bar progress indicator (with the benefit that with this action item the progress can be determinate).
 
The action item also supports adding a small badge that indicates that there is new data available.

</a>

Or browse the [source code of the sample application][5] for a complete example of use.

Including in your project
-------------------------

If youâ€™re using Eclipse with the ADT plugin you can include MultiChoiceAdaptar as a library project. Create a new Android project in Eclipse using the library/ folder as the existing source. Then, open the properties of this new project and, in the 'Android' category, add a reference to the ActionBarSherlock library project. Finally, in your application project properties, add a reference to the created library project.

If you use maven to build your Android project you can simply add a dependency for this library.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.manuelpeinado.multichoiceadapter</groupId>
        <artifactId>library</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.6</version>
        <type>apklib</type>
    </dependency>

Usage
---------

### If you need <code>BaseAdapter</code>-like functionality

Instead of deriving your adapter from BaseAdapter derive it from MultiChoiceBaseAdapter. You'll have to implement the usual BaseAdapter methods (getCount(), getItem()...), but instead of implementing BaseAdapter.getView(), implement getViewImpl(). You'll also have to implement the different ActionMode.Callback methods (onCreateActionMode, onActionModeClicked()...)

Once you've implemented your class that derives from MultiChoiceBaseAdapter, you attach an instance of it to your ListView like this:

	multiChoiceAdapter.setAdapterView(listView);
	multiChoiceAdapter.setOnItemClickListener(myItemListClickListener);

Do not call <code>setOnItemClickListener()</code> on your ListView, call it on the adapter instead.

Do not forget to derive your activity from one of the ActionBarSherlock activities, except SherlockListActivity which is not supported.

Finally, do not forget to call <code>save(outState)</code> from your activity's <code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> method. This is necessary for the selection state to be persisted across configuration changes.

### If you need <code>SimpleCursorAdapter</code>-like functionality

Derive your adapter from MultiChoiceSimpleCursorAdapter, implement the ActionMode.Callback methods and configure it at construction time using the different parameters of the MultiChoiceSimpleCursorAdapter constructor (cursor, from, to...)

### If you need <code>ArrayAdapter</code>-like functionality

Derive your adapter from MultiChoiceArrayAdapter, implement the ActionMode.Callback methods and configure it at construction time using the different parameters of the MultiChoiceArrayAdapter constructor (layoutResourceId, textViewResourceId)

Checkboxes
------------------

MultiChoiceAdapter handles list items with check-boxes transparently. Just add a CheckBox to your item's XML layout and give it the id <code>android.R.id.checkbox</code>.

Customization
---------------------

You can use a **custom background** (drawable or color) for the selected items of your list. To do so, add an item named <code>multiChoiceAdapterStyle</code> to your theme, and have it reference an additional style which you define like this:

    <style name="MyCustomMultiChoiceAdapter">
        <item name="selectedItemBackground">@color/my_custom_selected_item_background</item>
    </style>

See the sample application for a complete example.

You can also customize the way the adapter behaves when an item is clicked and **the action mode was already active**. Just add the following item to your style:

    <style name="MyCustomMultiChoiceAdapter">
        <item name="itemClickInActionMode">selectItem</item>
    </style>
    
Two values are supported:

* <code>selectItem</code>. Changes the selection state of the clicked item, just as if it had been long clicked. This is what the native MULTICHOICE_MODAL mode of List does, and what almost every app does, and thus the default value.
* <code>openItem</code>. Opens the clicked item, just as if it had been clicked outside of the action mode. This is what the native Gmail app does.
